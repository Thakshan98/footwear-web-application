                We work to connect readers with independent booksellers all over
                the world. We believe local bookstores are essential community
                hubs that foster culture, curiosity, and a love of reading, and
                we're committed to helping them survive and thrive. Our platform
                gives independent bookstores tools to compete online and
                financial support to help them maintain their presence in local
                communities.

                Book Corner began as an idea to help support bookstores and
                their communities at a time when more and more people were
                buying their books online. We saw an opportunity to create an
                alternative to Amazon for socially-conscious online shoppers.
                Amazon sells over 60% of all books in the US and is growing.
                That shift threatens the future of bookstores and will hurt
                readers, authors, and publishers who rely on a diverse, healthy
                ecosystem for books. We had a better idea â€” give readers the
                convenience of online shopping while supporting independent
                bookstores at the same time.
